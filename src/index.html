      <h2>The Good Old Kitchen</h2>
      <p>
        The Good Old Kitchen is not really so much a restaurant as it is my
        kitchen. It is the welcoming refuge for all munchies. Meals, snacks,
        beverages and even treats can be made here. <br />Meals are usually
        prepared once to twice a day. Self service available, provided you live
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Good Old Kitchen will hold all self service users responsible for
        restocking of emptied goods. Or so help me God...
